                Dalkey Ukulele Klub (DUK) was founded by Dalkey resident Debbie Emerson, on 25th April 2017.
                We have a great mix of people, from beginners to experienced musicians, and we all have a lot of fun.
                We play a wide range of music, from old classics to modern pop, and we are always looking for new songs to add to our repertoire.
                We meet up every week in Dalkey, and we also play at various events around the area throughout the year - we have even played at The National Concert Hall!
                Come join us to play a few tunes and have a laugh - we are always looking for new members!

            All you need is a ukulele! Come along for a bit of music and craic - all levels of ability welcome!
